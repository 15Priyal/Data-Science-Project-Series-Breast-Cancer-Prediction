Introduction:

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improved outcomes. Machine learning models can aid in the early detection of breast cancer by analyzing medical data and predicting the likelihood of malignancy.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for breast cancer prediction using machine learning techniques. The model will be trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to classify tumors as either malignant or benign. By leveraging features such as tumor size, shape, and texture, the model aims to provide accurate predictions that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing:
Clean the dataset and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Normalize or standardize the data to ensure consistency in feature scales.
Feature Selection and Engineering:
Identify relevant features that contribute significantly to breast cancer prediction.
Create new features or apply transformations to enhance the model's performance.
Machine Learning Model (SVM):
Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification.
Train the SVM model on the preprocessed dataset to classify tumors into malignant or benign.
Documentation:
Document the data preprocessing steps, feature selection process, and SVM model implementation.
Explain the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Discuss any challenges faced during the analysis and potential improvements for future iterations of the model.
By developing an accurate predictive model for breast cancer prediction, this project aims to contribute to early detection and improved treatment outcomes for patients.
